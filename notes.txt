API Design:
    Endpoints:
    
    Searching all component codes to filter available results
        READ(component code)
        GET
        response: [code1, code2, ...]
        
    Find compatible components
        READ(component code)
        GET 
        response: [
            {part1},{part2}, ...
        ]
        each part has code, category, pod, status, link, note
            
            - get list of all compatible parts, sort and display on front end
        

    Future Endpoints:
        CREATE user build
         - user info, build info, components in build
        UPDATE user build
         - user info, build info, components in build        
        DELETE user build
         - user info, build info, components in build

User authenticated build page
Recheck table indexing optimization
How to handle 1x drivetrain parts? Not connected to an FD / shifter but would still work with shifters as brakes.
