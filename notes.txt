API Design:
    Endpoints:
        READ(partName)
        Response: {
            [{part1},{part2},...]
        }

Todo:
User authenticated build page
Look into indexing tables
Functionality: take the queried part and return extra information regarding it? Link, block name?
How to implement block name? and overall name of system.
How to handle the * footnotes?
