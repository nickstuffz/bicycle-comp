# Formatting Rules for raw.json

## General Rules

- Each block should have a `name`, `category`, and `components` field.
- The `components` field is an array of objects, each with `code`, `link`, and `note` fields.

## Specific Rules

- The `note` field should have proper spaces and formatting.
- A `note` applies to all codes listed above it in the same block unless it runs into another note already on a code.
